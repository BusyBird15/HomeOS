# HomeOS
A simple operating system for Arduinos and Arduino-compatible boards.

* The code is maintained by me.
* The code is registered under The Unliscence.<br>

## Compatible modules
It is required to select one module from each group for the system to function properly.

* Thermometers: DHT11, DHT21, DHT22.
* Motion sensor (any generic human IR (PIR) sensor should work).

I havent started on this yet, but it will be done very soon.
